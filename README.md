# QWERTY - Typing Speed Test

Just a little typing speed test app I put together for fun using Alpine.js and Tailwind CSS. It’s got a chill Nord-inspired theme, a few different test modes, and shows some basic stats when you’re done typing. Nothing too serious—just something I wanted to mess around with!

## Features

- **Multiple Test Modes**: Words, Sentences, and Numbers
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, and Hard
- **Customizable Time Limits**: 15s, 30s, 60s
- **Real-time Statistics**: WPM, Accuracy, Errors tracking
- **Focus Mode**: Distraction-free typing experience
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between themes
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick access to common functions
- **Session Statistics**: Track your progress over time
- **Export Results**: Download your test results
- **Virtual Keyboard**: Visual feedback for key presses
